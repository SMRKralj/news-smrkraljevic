ERT said clinical trial patients were never at risk, but customers said the attack forced trial researchers to track their patients with pen and paper.</p><p class="paragraph par">Among those hit were IQVIA, the contract research organization helping manage AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine trial, and Bristol Myers Squibb, the drugmaker leading a consortium of companies to develop a quick test for the virus.</p><p class="paragraph par">ERT has not said how many clinical trials were affected, but its software is used in drug trials across Europe, Asia and North America. It was used in three-quarters of trials that led to drug approvals by the Food and Drug Administration last year, according to its website.</p></div>

As a precaution, Mr. Bustos said, the company took its systems offline that day, called in outside cybersecurity experts and notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p><div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_1_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac"></div><p class="paragraph par">“Nobody feels great about these experiences, but this has been contained,” Mr. Bustos said.

The attacks, once treated as a nuisance, have taken on greater urgency in recent weeks as American <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/technology/2020-election-security-threats.html" title="">officials worry they may interfere, directly or indirectly, with the November election</a>.</p><p class="paragraph par">A ransomware attack in Germany resulted in the first known death from a cyberattack in recent weeks, after Russian hackers seized 30 servers at University Hospital Düsseldorf, crashing systems and forcing the hospital to turn away emergency patients. As a result, the German authorities said, a woman in a life-threatening condition was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/world/europe/cyber-attack-germany-ransomeware-death.html" title="">sent to a hospital 20 miles away in Wuppertal and died from treatment delays.</a></p><p class="paragraph par">One of ERT’s clients, IQVIA, said it had been able to limit problems because it had backed up its data. Bristol Myers Squibb also said the impact of the attack had been limited, but other ERT customers had to move their clinical trials to pen and paper.</p><p class="paragraph par">In a statement, IQVIA said the attack had “had limited impact on our clinical trials operations,” and added, “We are not aware of any confidential data or patient information, related to our clinical trial activities, that have been removed, compromised or stolen.”</p><p class="paragraph par">Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson, two companies working on a coronavirus vaccine, said their coronavirus vaccine trials had not been affected.</p><p class="paragraph par">“ERT is not a technology provider for or otherwise involved in Pfizer’s Phase 1/2/3 Covid-19 vaccine clinical trials,” Amy Rose, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said.</p><p class="paragraph par">Companies and research labs on the front lines of the pandemic have been repeat targets for foreign hackers over the past seven months, as countries around the world try to gauge one another’s responses and progress in addressing the virus. In May, the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security warned that Chinese government spies were actively trying to steal American clinical research through cybertheft.</p>
